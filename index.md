## Description
This repository contains whitepapers with in-depth report on specific topics
that are related to Cray Programming Environments softwares.

### Message Passing Toolkit

**MPI Dynamic Process Management**

This document describes the use of MPI Dynamic Process Management or DPM. This
includes _MPI\_Comm\_spawn_, _MPI\_Comm\_connect_, _MPI\_Comm\_accept_ and
related DPM functionality, as well as a Cray extension, _MPIX\_Comm\_rankpool_.

### Cray OpenSHMEMX

**Introducing Cray OpenSHMEMX**

OpenSHMEM is a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) library interface
specification, which is the culmination of a standardization effort among many
implementers and users of SHMEM programming model. SHMEM has a long history as
a parallel programming model. It is extensively used since 1993, starting from
Cray T3D systems. For the past two decades SHMEM library implementation in Cray
systems evolved through different generations. The current generation of the
SHMEM implementation for Cray XC and XK systems is called Cray SHMEM. Cray SHMEM
is a proprietary SHMEM implementation from Cray Inc., which is OpenSHMEM
standard compliant. In this paper, we introduce the next generation OpenSHMEM
implementation for current and future generation Cray systems. We call this new
implementation **Cray OpenSHMEMX**. In this paper, we provide a brief design
overview of the implementation along with the usage details, functional
differences and performance optimizations over the existing Cray SHMEM
implementation.
